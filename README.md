Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various machine learning tasks. Each task is contained in a separate Jupyter notebook.

## Contents

- **AgeGenderDetection.ipynb**:
  Developed a deep learning model for age and gender detection 
  utilizing (CNN). Leveraged the UTKFace dataset, which 
  comprises over 20,000 images of diverse age groups and 
  genders, to train and validate the model.
- **CaloriesForFatLossAndMuscleGain.ipynb**:
  Interviews and Q&A sessions were conducted with expert 
  Dietitians to understand the features of the dataset. Synthetic 
  data was created with the help of domain experts and a 
  Multiple Linear Regression Model was trained and validated.
- **KMeans_Iris Dataset.ipynb**: This notebook demonstrates the use of K-Means clustering on the Iris dataset.
- **MultipleLinearRegression- Housing Dataset.ipynb**: This notebook showcases a multiple linear regression model on a housing dataset.
- **pneumoniaPredictionCNN.ipynb**: This notebook contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for predicting pneumonia from chest X-ray images.
